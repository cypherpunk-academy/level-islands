## Engine Rules

### Generell boundaries

One instance of the level islands can hold a maximum of 250 players.
Every town cost a different amount and type of fruits.
You don't know how much, until you try.
If you don't have enough, Wunderlich comes.
In front of each entrance is also a sphinx.
The first time she always wakes up.
Other time, she might (when she is interested).

### Town functions

Temple: Central place where the thought is kept

Hacker space: Place to get hints and tools

Exchange: Place to swap fruits (from level 1)

City hall: Who contributed to what? Who owns the city?

Library: Place for further reading, links to the real world (from level 2)

Court house: Special moral cases, for players to decide (entry from level 5))


### Temple

A sphinx in front of each temple
The thought of the temple in the middle. 
Four objections, one in every corner.
Four answers hiding doors behind the objections.
If a player goes into one corner, he reads the objection and the answer, then ~20 other answers appear of which ~5 are right.
He has to find out all right ones to open the door.
If he is wrong, he must spend an error stone.
If he has no error stones he leaves the temple.
Error stones can be traded at an Exchange, for the current rate.
If he is right, he can comment on the answer:
	- I understand it better as the original
	- I like it more as the original
	- It hits the point better as the original
	- It's simpler as the original


#### A temple door opens

When a door opens, a player has two options. 
He can go through and follow the path out of the city. 
It will lead to another city, to a level haven or to a dead end.

The second option is to write an own variation of an answer, using own words.
The program will check if it is too similar to an existing one and if not accept it.
If accepted it will be added to the pool of answers with the status 'candidate'.
Within the ~20 answers displayed, there are always some candidates.
If a candidate is chosen more often right than other answers it gets promoted to 'apprentice'.
If it is flaged by a player as too fuzzy, not matching the meaning of the original or other reasons, the decision is passed to the judges of this player and the author.
If they don't agree, they pass it on to their judges, and so one.
Until decided the answer stays in.
After a period of time the answer that is chosen right most often is promoted to 'original' and replaces the former original which becomes 'candidate' again.


#### An answer is promoted to 'original'

After an answer is promoted to original, the player becomes an owner and is listed in the city hall.
Original answers earn a share of the income of the village.

#### If a player holds all four original answers

If a player holds all four original answers at a time he is promoted to mayor.
He then receives the same income regardless if some of his answers become candidate again.
He gets the income for lost original from the island, so other player can have it from the city.

### Navigation

To new places everyone has to walk.
There he can collect a position stone.
With this he can jump to this place the next time.


## How thoughts, objections and answers should be written

The original thought is written in bear language (Wim), how the bear speaks to 14 years old children
The objection is written as a quote of a human living at the beginning of the 21st century.
The orignal answers are written in the language of a 14 years old children.
Answers can be no more than 400 characters.


## How answers are checked

Important words in answers are marked by the author. At least 12 per answer.
Any other answer must not have more than half of the same important words as any other answer.
Any answer must not have more than half of the same other words that have 5 letters or more.
No tricks allowed (can be flagged as trick).

### Flags

- Trick
- Doesn't match the meaning
- Too unclear, too general




## Visual Ideas

Temples are square and in the center of the city.
Temples should look very bright and beautiful, outside and inside, only a touch of warm colors outside, otherwise shades of grey
Inside blue tones, sometimes greenish, much natural light. No red. The only warm colours inside are flowers.

The thought in the middle is represented by a colorful artwork made of stone, metal or concrete (no wood, no plastic, all colors allowed)
The thought is always readable from all sides

## Acoustic Ideas


## Technical Ideas

All thoughts are stored together with objections and original answers in single asciidoc files.
If players want to change these they have to issue real pull requests.
